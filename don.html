                    "Don Quixote" is a novel written by Miguel de Cervantes and published in two parts, in 1605 and 1615, respectively. It is considered one of the greatest works of literature and the first modern novel.<br>
                    The novel follows the adventures of a man named Alonso Quixano, who becomes obsessed with the chivalric romances of old. He decides to become a knight-errant and takes on the name Don Quixote de la Mancha, embarking on a series of adventures with his loyal squire, Sancho Panza.<br>
                    Don Quixote's adventures are both humorous and poignant, as he tilts at windmills he believes to be giants, mistakes inns for castles, and battles imaginary foes. Throughout his journey, he encounters a colorful cast of characters, including love interests, villains, and fellow adventurers.<br>
                    Despite his eccentricities and the ridicule of those around him, Don Quixote remains steadfast in his belief in honor, chivalry, and the pursuit of noble quests. His idealism often clashes with the harsh realities of the world, leading to moments of both triumph and tragedy.<br>
                    The novel is a profound exploration of the human condition, touching on themes of identity, illusion, and the power of imagination. It challenges the reader to question the nature of reality and the meaning of heroism.<br>
                    "Don Quixote" has had a lasting impact on literature and popular culture, inspiring countless adaptations, parodies, and homages. It continues to captivate readers with its wit, humor, and timeless wisdom.
