                "Crime and Punishment" is a novel written by Fyodor Dostoevsky and published in 1866. It is considered one of the greatest works of Russian literature and a seminal work of existentialist fiction.<br>
                The novel follows the story of Rodion Raskolnikov, a impoverished former student living in St. Petersburg. Raskolnikov is consumed by nihilistic and existentialist ideas, leading him to believe that certain individuals, known as "supermen," are exempt from moral and societal laws.<br>
                Raskolnikov concocts a plan to test his theory by murdering an elderly pawnbroker and stealing her money. He believes that the ends justify the means and that his actions will serve a greater purpose. However, the murder leaves Raskolnikov tormented by guilt and haunted by the consequences of his crime.<br>
                Throughout the novel, Raskolnikov grapples with his conscience and struggles to come to terms with his actions. He becomes increasingly isolated and paranoid, alienating himself from his family and friends.<br>
                Meanwhile, Raskolnikov is pursued by the relentless and astute police detective, Porfiry Petrovich, who suspects him of the murder. As the investigation intensifies, Raskolnikov's mental state deteriorates, and he becomes consumed by fear and paranoia.<br>
                Alongside the main narrative, the novel explores the lives of other characters, including Sonya Marmeladov, a young prostitute who becomes Raskolnikov's confidante and moral compass. Sonya's unwavering faith and compassion serve as a contrast to Raskolnikov's moral ambiguity.<br>
                As the novel unfolds, Raskolnikov is forced to confront the consequences of his actions and ultimately confesses to the murder. He is sentenced to exile in Siberia, where he begins a process of spiritual and moral redemption.<br>
                "Crime and Punishment" delves into themes of guilt, redemption, and the nature of justice. It explores the complexities of the human psyche and the moral dilemmas faced by individuals living in a harsh and unforgiving world.<br>
                Dostoevsky's masterful portrayal of Raskolnikov's inner turmoil and psychological descent into madness makes "Crime and Punishment" a timeless masterpiece of literature that continues to captivate readers with its profound insights into the human condition.
