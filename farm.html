                "Animal Farm" is a novella written by George Orwell and published in 1945. It is a satirical allegory that reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the subsequent Stalinist era in the Soviet Union.<br>
                The story takes place on a farm where the animals, led by the pigs, revolt against their human owner, Mr. Jones, and establish their own self-governing society based on the principles of Animalism. The pigs, led by the clever and manipulative Napoleon, gradually consolidate their power and establish a dictatorship over the other animals.<br>
                Initially, the farm is run on egalitarian principles, with all animals considered equal. However, as time passes, the pigs begin to assert their dominance and exploit the other animals for their own gain. They rewrite the commandments of Animalism to justify their actions and oppress any dissent.<br>
                As the pigs become more corrupt and authoritarian, the farm descends into chaos and misery. The animals suffer under the pigs' rule, working harder and receiving less in return. Any opposition is brutally suppressed, and dissenters are labeled as traitors and enemies of the farm.<br>
                The novel explores themes of power, corruption, and the nature of totalitarianism. It serves as a critique of the Soviet Union under Stalin and totalitarian regimes in general, highlighting the dangers of unchecked authority and the manipulation of language and ideology to maintain control.<br>
                "Animal Farm" is a powerful and thought-provoking allegory that continues to resonate with readers as a warning against tyranny and the erosion of freedom and equality.
